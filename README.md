# Metro-Turnstile-Controller-FSM-Design-
I designed a Metro Turnstile controller using Verilog HDL based on a finite state machine (FSM). The system operates in two main states: Locked and Unlocked, transitioning based on coin insertion and passenger pass signals. The design was verified through waveform simulation in Xilinx Vivado to ensure correct access control behavior.
