# Metro-Turnstile-Controller-FSM-Design-
I designed a Metro Turnstile controller using Verilog HDL based on a finite state machine (FSM). The system operates in two main states: Locked and Unlocked, transitioning based on coin insertion and passenger pass signals. The design was verified through waveform simulation in Xilinx Vivado to ensure correct access control behavior.

this is the simulation of this project
